### About Me

I am from Patchogue, Long Island. From years K-12, I went to Patchogue-Medford School District and graduated from the high school in June, 2020. Hobbies I have include playing the piano and saxophone, spending time with family and friends and playing videogames. I am the youngest child in my family, having 2 older siblings - a 22 year old brother and a 20 year old sister.

###My favorite food is Pizza! (has to be from NYC or Long Island =P)
